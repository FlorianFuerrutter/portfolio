## Engineering College Thesis (*HTL-Diplomarbeit*)
My Thesis for acquiring the engineer title. In cooperation with [*Swarovski*](https://www.swarovski.com). 

![example stone image](/htl_thesis/front.jpg)

**Abstract**:
Some crystal glassware of Swarovski is marked by means of laser engraving. The 
quality control of the engravings is currently done manually by random sampling. This manual quality assurance does not meet the Swarovski quality standards any more. In addition, it does not prevent the delivery of inferior goods to customers. 
The manual verification of the engravings should be replaced with an automated image processing system. The design of a concept and development is part of the project. The intention of the project is a finished prototype which fully automatically verifies the engraving of a manually inserted crystal using image processing software. In this way, a detection of inferior crystals according to clearly defined quality standards is possible. The software is able to get images from the camera and execute analyzing algorithms. 

**Keywords**: image processing, GUI, Qt, automation, OpenCV, SQL
